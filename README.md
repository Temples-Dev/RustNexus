**RustNexus** is a modular, performance-driven backend framework built with **Rust**. It provides a powerful foundation for developing fast, reliable web applications, focusing on simplicity and abstraction. Designed with flexibility in mind, RustNexus allows developers to plug in any frontend framework (e.g., Remix, React) while maintaining a robust backend powered by **Axum** and the **Tokio** stack.

## Key Features
- **Modular MVC Architecture** (without the view): Backend structure inspired by MVC principles, with the flexibility to choose any frontend.
- **High Performance**: Leveraging Rustâ€™s memory safety and concurrency for optimal speed and efficiency.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend or swap components, allowing for a customizable backend setup.
- **Pluggable Frontend**: Integrate seamlessly with your frontend framework of choice.

RustNexus is ideal for developers looking to build high-performance, scalable applications with a clean and decoupled backend architecture.
